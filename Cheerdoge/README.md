   I have two cute oc. They are cute and I'm glad to introduce them to you.
   * 🦴Cheerdoge(旺柴)🦴
    He is a **Shiba Inu**🐶 which likes playing game. He is created by one of my best friends🥰. When I perfected his character design, I basically modeled it after my self. Here is he!![旺柴](./旺柴.png)
   * ⭐Cynosure(辰戌)⭐
    This is **my first original character** which was created all by myself. I wish he is **the symbol of the meteor✨ and wishes**, but he is a dog🐶, too.(🥰\I like dog! Please support dog!) So I use the elements of stars to creat it. His original name is Stelle, but I change it to Cynosure.They all have meaning of stars.![辰戌](./辰戌.png)
